1. board generation
	start at any square
	add a "1" there
	move in any direction
	either:
		if you hit into a catchment zone from the side, pull the related object to you and move the other direction
		or stop at any point, add a 1, then move
		
catchment zones are: the 4 orthogonal points from a position, which can only be entered orthogonal to 

    P
   ECE
   
  For the point P, the south catchment zone can only be entered from the points E.

3. think about a better data structure - combined v&h of what i'm doing now?  the problem is any change distorts it so greatly.  still, it makes caching work well.  what's a nice way to convert

4. deadends - a 1 needs either a 1 on the same row, or a 2 one row over, or a 3 2 rows over, etc. or the same thing on a column.  this can force certain 2s to require being moved in a certain direction.
